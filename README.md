##About Me

Hello I'm Fdi, currently Data Scientist/ML Engineer

Most repos are ML related stuff, either former school projects, fun ideas that I'm trying to implement, projects that are being used to learn some new skill/library/software, and sometimes use cases that have been requested of me for technical interviews. 

The majority of those are probably not finished, since I have a (bad) habit of starting projects and never finishing them (I'm trying though).
