Data Scientist/ML Engineer

Most repos are ML related stuff, either former school projects, fun ideas that I'm trying to implement, projects that are being used to learn some new skill/library/software, and sometimes use cases that have been requested of me for technical interviews. 

Currently building some sports related things :
- Strava Companion App (coming soon !)
- Computer Vision App for Indoor Football (coming less soon)
